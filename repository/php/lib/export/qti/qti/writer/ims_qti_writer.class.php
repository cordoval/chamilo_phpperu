     * @param $identifier The principle identifier of the test. This identifier must have a corresponding entry in the test's meta-data. See Meta-data and Usage Data for more information.

    /**
     *
     * @param $identifier
     * @param navigationMode $navigationMode The navigation mode determines the general paths that the candidate may take. A testPart in linear mode restricts the candidate to attempt each item in turn. Once the candidate moves on they are not permitted to return. A testPart in nonlinear mode removes this restriction - the candidate is free to navigate to any item in the test at any time. Test delivery systems are free to implement their own user interface elements to facilitate navigation provided they honor the navigation mode currently in effect. A test delivery system may implement nonlinear mode simply by providing a method to step forward or backwards through the test part.
     * @param submissionMode $submissionMode The submission mode determines when the candidate's responses are submitted for response processing. A testPart in individual mode requires the candidate to submit their responses on an item-by-item basis. In simultaneous mode the candidate's responses are all submitted together at the end of the testPart.
     * The choice of submission mode determines the states through which each item's session can pass during the test. In simultaneous mode, response processing cannot take place until the testPart is complete so each item session passes between the interacting and suspended states only. By definition the candidate can take one and only one attempt at each item and feedback cannot be seen during the test. Whether or not candidates can return to review their responses and/or any item-level feedback after the test, is outside the scope of this specification. Simultaneous mode is typical of paper-based tests.
     * In individual mode, response processing may take place during the test and the item session may pass through any of the states described in Items, subject to the itemSessionControl settings in force. Care should be taken when designing user interfaces for systems that support nonlinear navigation mode in combination with individual submission. With this combination candidates may change their responses for an item and then leave it in the suspended state by navigating to a different item in the same part of the test. Test delivery systems need to make it clear to candidates that there are unsubmitted responses (akin to unsaved changes in a traditional document editing system) at the end of the test part. A test delivery system may force candidates to submit or discard such responses before moving to a different item in individual mode if this is more appropriate.

    /**
     * When items are referenced as part of a test, the test may impose constraints on how many attempts and which states are allowed. These constraints can be specified for individual items, for whole sections, or for an entire testPart. By default, a setting at testPart level affects all items in that part unless the setting is overridden at the assessmentSection level or ultimately at the individual assessmentItemRef. The defaults given below are used only in the absence of any applicable constraint.
     * @param $maxAttempts For non-adaptive items, maxAttempts controls the maximum number of attempts allowed in the given test context. Normally this is 1 as the scoring rules for non-adaptive items are the same for each attempt. A value of 0 indicates no limit. If it is unspecified it is treated as 1 for non-adaptive items. For adaptive items, the value of maxAttempts is ignored as the number of attempts is limited by the value of the completionStatus built-in outcome variable.
     * A value of maxAttempts greater than 1, by definition, indicates that any applicable feedback must be shown. This applies to both Modal Feedback and Integrated Feedback where applicable. However, once the maximum number of allowed attempts have been used (or for adaptive items, completionStatus has been set to completed) whether or not feedback is shown is controlled by the showFeedback constraint.
     * @param $showFeedback This constraint affects the visibility of feedback after the end of the last attempt. If it is false then feedback is not shown. This includes both Modal Feedback and Integrated Feedback even if the candidate has access to the review state. The default is false.
     * @param $allowReview This constraint also applies only after the end of the last attempt. If set to true the item session is allowed to enter the review state during which the candidate can review the itemBody along with the responses they gave, but cannot update or resubmit them. If set to false the candidate can not review the itemBody or their responses once they have submitted their last attempt. The default is true.
     * If the review state is allowed, but feedback is not, delivery systems must take extra care not to show integrated feedback that resulted from the last attempt as part of the review process. Feedback can however take the form of hiding material that was previously visible, as well as the more usual form of showing material that was previously hidden.
     * To resolve this ambiguity, for non-adaptive items the absence of feedback is defined to be the version of the itemBody displayed to the candidate at the start of each attempt. In other words, with the visibility of any integrated feedback determined by the default values of the outcome variables and not the values of the outcome variables updated by the invocation of response processing.
     * For Adaptive Items the situation is complicated by the iterative nature of response processing which makes it hard to identify the appropriate state in which to place the item for review. To avoid requiring delivery engines to cache the values of the outcome variables the setting of showFeedback should be ignored for adaptive items when allowReview is true. When in the review state, the final values of the outcome variables should be used to determine the visibility of integrated feedback.
     * @param $showSolution This constraint controls whether or not the system may provide the candidate with a way of entering the solution state. The default is false.
     * @param $allowComment Some delivery systems support the capture of candidate comments. The comment is not part of the assessed responses but provides feedback from the candidate to the other actors in the assessment process. This constraint controls whether or not the candidate is allowed to provide a comment on the item during the session.
     * @param $allowSkipping An item is defined to be skipped if the candidate has not provided any response. In other words, all response variables are submitted with their default value or are NULL. This definition is consistent with the numberResponded operator available in outcomeProcessing. If false, candidates are not allowed to skip the item, or in other words, they are not allowed to submit the item until they have provided a non-default value for at least one of the response variables. By definition, an item with no response variables cannot be skipped. The value of this attribute is only applicable when the item is in a testPart with individual submission mode. Note that if allowSkipping is true delivery engines must ensure that the candidate can choose to submit no response, for example, through the provision of a "skip" button.
     * @param $validateResponses This attribute controls the behavior of delivery engines when the candidate submits an invalid response. An invalid response is defined to be a response which does not satisfy the constraints imposed by the interaction with which it is associated. See interaction for more information. When validateResponses is turned on (true) then the candidates are not allowed to submit the item until they have provided valid responses for all interactions. When turned off (false) invalid responses may be accepted by the system. The value of this attribute is only applicable when the item is in a testPart with individual submission mode. (See Navigation and Submission.)

     * @param $title The title of the section is intended to enable the section to be selected in situations where the contents of the section are not available, for example when a candidate is browsing a test. Therefore, delivery engines may reveal the title to candidates at any time during the test but are not required to do so.
     * @param $visible A visible section is one that is identifiable by the candidate. For example, delivery engines might provide a hierarchical view of the test to aid navigation. In such a view, a visible section would be a visible node in the hierarchy. Conversely, an invisible section is one that is not visible to the candidate�the child elements of an invisible section appear to the candidate as if they were part of the parent section (or testPart). The visibility of a section does not affect the visibility of its child elements. The visibility of each section is determined solely by the value of its own visible attribute.
     * @param $keepTogether An invisible section with a parent that is subject to shuffling can specify whether or not its children, which will appear to the candidate as if they were part of the parent, are shuffled as a block or mixed up with the other children of the parent section.
     * @param $required If a child element is required it must appear (at least once) in the selection. It is in error if a section contains a selection rule that selects fewer child elements than the number of required elements it contains.
     * @param $fixed If a child element is fixed it must never be shuffled. When used in combination with a selection rule fixed elements do not have their position fixed until after selection has taken place. For example, selecting 3 elements from {A,B,C,D} without replacement might result in the selection {A,B,C}. If the section is subject to shuffling but B is fixed then permutations such as {A,C,B} are not allowed whereas permutations like {C,B,A} are.

The syntax of this identifier is more restrictive than that of the identifier attribute of the assessmentItem itself.
