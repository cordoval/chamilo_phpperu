/**
 * Rule checking that uploaded file is of the correct MIME type
 *
 * The Rule needs one configuration parameter for its work: a string with a 
 * desired MIME type or array of such strings. The parameter may be passed to
 * {@link HTML_QuickForm2_Rule::setOptions() setOptions()} or to
 * {@link HTML_QuickForm2_Factory::registerRule()}. Parameter registered with the 
 * Factory overrides one set for the particular Rule instance via setOptions().
 *
 * The Rule considers missing file uploads (UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE) valid.
