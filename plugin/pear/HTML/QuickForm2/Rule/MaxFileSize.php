/**
 * Rule checking that uploaded file size does not exceed the given limit
 *
 * The Rule needs one configuration parameter for its work: the size limit.
 * This limit can be passed either to
 * {@link HTML_QuickForm2_Rule::setOptions() setOptions()} or to
 * {@link HTML_QuickForm2_Factory::registerRule()}. Limit registered with the 
 * Factory overrides one set for the particular Rule instance via setOptions().
 *
 * Note that if file upload failed due to upload_max_filesize php.ini setting
 * or MAX_FILE_SIZE form field, then this rule won't even be called, due to
 * File element's built-in validation setting the error message.
 *
 * The Rule considers missing file uploads (UPLOAD_ERR_NO_FILE) valid.
