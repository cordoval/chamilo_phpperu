Acceptance Tests :
==================

These tests are automated stories that simulates the usage of the complete system from a client.
They simulate several request and assert the result is as expected from the client perspective.

These test can train several functionalities at once or can train nonfunctional requirements.

Functional Tests :
==================

These tests trains a single piece of functionality. They might tests a single request or a call
to a third party service.

Performance Tests :
==================

Test a piece of code (small or large) under stress.

Unit Tests :
=============

Test a small piece of code in isolation. Dependencies are mocked out and the assertions are all
made about the small piece of code under test (most of the time a single function/method)
