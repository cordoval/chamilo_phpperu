
Chamilo 2.0 Release INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading Chamilo! This text will guide you through the
basics of installing Chamilo 2.0. Please read this fully before proceeding
with the installation.

This is only a short installation guide. We are writing a manual with more
info on installation, but this was not ready at the time of writing. When
ready, this manual will be accessible through the Chamilo website

1. Requirements
---------------

Chamilo is a web application which requires some other software to function:
a web server, PHP, and the MySQL database server. These software packages
have to be installed on the computer where you will install Chamilo.

You can install all these software packages separately, which often gives
the best results. However, beginning users who want to test Chamilo can use
a combination package that installs all these software packages in one
simple install. If you want to use a combination package, we recommend
WAMP or XAMP.

WAMP5 website: http://www.wampserver.com
XAMP: http://www.apachefriends.org

1.1. A webserver

The Apache web server is recommended, and Chamilo is configured to use some
Apache security enhancements if possible. However, other web servers will
work too. For best security results, you need to have the Apache module
mod_rewrite activated. 

Download Apache web server:
http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

1.2. PHP

You need PHP version 5.3 minimum and configured with the
following modules : 

* gd
* pcre
* session
* standard
* mysql
* zlib
* xsl 

Their presence is also checked by the Chamilo install script.
Download PHP: http://www.php.net/downloads.php

Some users could meet problems if their PHP setting doesn't fit these ones:

* output_buffering = Off

BSD users:
these php libraries have to be included during php installation:
* php-mysql The mysql shared extension for php
* php-pcre The pcre shared extension for php
* php-session The session shared extension for php
* php-zlib The zlib shared extension for php
* (optional) php-ldap if you want to be able to use LDAP authentication


1.3. The MySQL database server

And a login/password allowing to administrate and create at least one
database. Download MySQL server: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

1.4. Permissions
Furthermore, you need web Write access to web directory where Chamilo has
been moved or unzipped to. On a Windows machine locally, this is not a
problem. Remotely, you need to be allowed to CHMOD through FTP, telnet or
any means.


2. Installing a new version of Chamilo
--------------------------------------

2.1. Download the Chamilo 2.0 install package (.zip for Windows users
or .tar.gz for all others) from the Chamilo download page:
http://www.chamilo.org/nl/node/94

2.2. Unzip or untar the downloaded install package. Most current operating
systems can do this with a built-in graphical application, if this doesn't
work you can open a commandline, go to the download directory and type
tar -zxvf chamilo-2.0.tar.gz

2.3. Move by any means (FTP, SCP, local file copy) the contents of the
Chamilo install package to your website on your webserver (whether webroot
or subdirectory). Your webserver can also be your local computer. Be sure
to copy all the folders as well as all the .php files.

For Windows users: If you use e.g easyphp locally (http://www.easyphp.org),
just drag and drop the contents of the Chamilo install package into
C:\Program Files\easyphp\www\


On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the CHMOD 666
command for this. In Windows, you may need to check the properties of
the folders.

2.4. The following directories need to be readable, writeable and executable
for everyone:

chamilo/files/
chamilo/common/configuration/

On Linux, Mac OS X and BSD operating systems you can use the CHMOD 777
command for this. In Windows, you may need to check the properties of
the folders.

2.6. Open a web browser and go to
http://www.yourserver.org/yoursite/chamilo/index.php

For Windows users locally, with e.g easyphp or another combination package,
open http://localhost/chamilo/index.php

2.7. Click on the install button and follow instructions. Windows: with
combination packages like easyphp, out of the box, login and password for
MySQL should probably remain empty.

2.8. Security after installation

Protect your configuration file make sure no one can overwrite it. You can find the config file in 
(chamilo folder)/common/configuration/configuration.php.

 Make it read-only (windows/xwindows: right-click the file to edit the properties.
linux/bsd/macosx: use the chmod 444 command).

Protect your installation folder
if the (chamilo folder)/install folder is still accessible,
someone could install over your existing version (you could lose your data
that way). Move the folder somewhere out of the web directories so it is
not accessible, change its name, or edit its properties so no one can read
or execute it.
