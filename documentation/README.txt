SCORM
=====

For more information on Scorm normalisation, see http://www.adlnet.org


LICENSE
=======

Chamilo is distributed under the GNU General Public license (GPL).
See the file license.txt for all details.


PORTABILITY
===========

Chamilo is an AMP software. This means it should work on any platform running Apache
+ MySQL + PHP. It is then supposed to work on the following Operating Systems :

	Linux
	Windows (98, Me, NT4, 2000, XP)
	Unix
	Mac OS X

We tested it on
- Fedora, Mandrake, Red Hat Enterprise Server,
- Windows XP, Windows 2000
- Mac OS X 10.3

Email functions remain silent on systems where there is no mail sending software
(Sendmail, Postfix, Hamster...), which is the case by default on a Windows machine.


INTEROPERABILITY
================

Chamilo imports Scorm compliant learning contents. It imports then "On the shelve"
contents from many companies : NETg, Skillsoft, Explio, Microsoft, Macromedia, etc.

Admin interface imports users through CSV and XML. You can create a CSV file from
a list of users in MS Excel. OpenOffice can export to both CSV and XML formats.
Many database management systems, like Oracle, SAP, Access, SQL-Server, LDAP ...
export to CSV and/or XML.

Chamilo includes a LDAP module that allows admin to deactivate MySQL authentication
and replace it by connection to a LDAP directory.

Client side, Chamilo runs on any browser : Firefox, MS Internet Explorer (5.0+), Netscape (4.7+),
Mozilla (1.2+), Safari, Opera, ...


PHP Configuration
=================

Chamilo needs PHP version 4.3.2 or later (4.x versions), configured with the
following modules : mysql, zlib, preg, xml. PHP versions 5 or later are not
supported by Dokes yet. It will accept the following settings :

safe_mode				= Off
magic_quotes_gpc		= On
magic_quotes_runtime	= Off
short_open_tag			= On

The backticks charachter (`) inserted inside some of the Chamilo SQL queries doesn't
work with MySQL versions previous to 3.23.6

In some sections (Backup, Documents, Learning Path..), Chamilo requires the "zlib"
library on windows servers or the unzip shell software on Linux/Unix servers.


SECURITY
==============

In Chamilo 1.6, security and interoperability have been improved. Protection
for documents has improved, and courses have more accessibility options.
Password encryption is enabled by default. The php.ini setting
"register globals" does not have be on anymore.
